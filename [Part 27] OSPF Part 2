OSPF Cost:
	- Metric is called cost in OSPF
	- Calculated by dividing a reference bandwidth by the interfaces bandwidth
	- Default reference is 100
	- All values less than 1 = 1
	- Reference/Interface bandwidth
	"auto-cost reference-bandwidth <number>"
		- Change reference bandwidth
	
	- You should configure a reference bandwidth grater than the fastest links in your network
	- Configure on all routers in the network
	- Loopback interfaces have cost of 1
	"ip ospf cost <cost>"
		- Configure cost on interface
		
	"bandwidth <bandwidth (kbs)>" Only changes value used to calculate cost, "speed <speed>" Changes actual speed

OSPF Neighbors:
	- Down State:
		- Doesnt know any neighbors
	- Init
		- Hello packet is received
	- 2-way state
		- Sends back packet with both RIDs
		- Router received a packet with its own RID in it
	- Exstart state
		- Router with higher RID will become master
		- Lower RID will be slave
		- Prepare to send LSDBs
	- Exchange State
		- Exchange DBDs which contain a list of LSAS in their LSDBs
		- Not sending full LSAs just that they have them
	- Loading
		- Routers send LSR messages to send them LSAS they don't have
		- Routers send LSUs containing LSAs the neighbor does not have
		- LSAck to acknoledge that they received
	- Full
		- Routers have full OSPF adjacency
		- Dead timer of 40s
		- Neighbor is removed if dead timer = 0
		
"show ip ospf neighbor"
"ip ospf <process-id> rea <area>"
"passive-interface default" Enables passive interface on all interfaces
	- "no passive-interface <iface>" to disable on specific interfaces
