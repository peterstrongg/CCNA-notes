TCP:
	- Connection Oriented
		- Establish connection before sending data
	- Reliable
	- Dest must acknoledge that it receives each TCP segment
	- If host doesnt receive ACK, it sends segment again
	- Sequence Number
	- Flow control
		- Dest host can tell source to increase/decrease rate that data is sent

	- SYN, ACK	<-
	- ACK ->
	- Termination of connections:
		- FIN ->
		- ACK <-
		- FIN <-
