RIP:
	- Routing INformation Protocol
	- Distance Vector IGP
	- Hop Count Metric
	- 15 hops maximum
	- RIPv1 and RIPv2 for ipv4
	- RIPng for ipv6
	Message Types:
		- Request: asks RIP enabled neighbor routers to send their routing table
		- Response: To send the local routers routing table to neghboring routers
		
	- RIP enabled routers share their routing table every 30 seconds
	
RIPv1:
	- Advertises classful addresses
	- No support for VLSM and CIDR
	- Subnet mask info is not included, assumes class by ip range 

RIPv2:
	- Supports VLSM and CIDR
	- Subnet mask info in advertisements
	- Messages are multicast to 224.0.0.9
	
"router rip": enter rip config mode
"version 2"
"no auto-summary": auto-summary converts to classes IPs
"network 10.0.0.0": 	
	- Look for interfaces with an IP address that is in the specified range
	- Active RIP on the interfaces that fall in the range
	- Form adjacencies with connceted RIP neighbors
	- Advertise network prefix of the interfaces
	- Tells router which interfaces to activate RIP on 

"passive-interface g2/0": Stops sending RIP advertisements out of the G2/0 interface
"default-information originate": Default routes are advertised
"show ip protocols"
"maximum paths <number>" Max hop config (default 4)
"distance <distance>" change AD

EIGRP:
	- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
	- Formerly Cisco Proprietary but opened it
	- Multicast 224.0.0.10
	- Only IGP that can perform unequal cost load balancing
	- Wildcard mask
		- Inverted subnet mask

"router eigrp <AS Number>"
"no auto-summary"
"passive interface g2/0"
"network <ip>"
