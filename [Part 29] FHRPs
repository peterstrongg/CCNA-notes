FHRPs:
	- Protect the default gateway used on a subnet by allowing two or
	more routers to provide backup for that address; in the event of a 
	failure of an active router, the backup router will take over the address
	
Routers share a VIP (Virtual IP Address) PCs are configured to have default gateway to VIP
Router Pairs send messages to negotiate which and active and standby

HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
	- Cisco Proprietary
	- Activae and standby router are selected
	- 2 versions
		- V2 adds IPv6 support and increases the number of groups that can be configured
		- Mixed version is not acceptable
	- v1: 224.0.0.2
	- v2: 224.0.0.102
	- Virtual MACs:
		- V1: 0000.0c07.acxx (XX = HSRP GROUP NUMBER)
		- V2: 0000.0c9f.fXXX (XXX = HSRP GROUP NUMBER)
		
VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
	- Open Standary
	- Master and backup router
	- 224.0.0.18
	- VMAC: 0000.5e00.01XX

GLBP (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol)
	- Cisco Proprietary
	- Load balances within a single subnet
	- AVG (Active virtual gateway) is elected
	- AVFs forward to AVG
	- 224.0.0.102
	- VMAC: 0007.b400.XXYY (XX= GLBP group number, YY = AVFs  number)
	
HSRP Config:
	- Interface config mode
	- "standby version <vers. no>
	- "standby <group-number>"
	- group No. must match between routers
	- "standby 1 ip <gateway ip>"
	- "standby 1 priority <priority>"
		- Highest Priority
		- Highest IP
	- "standby 1 preempt"
	- "show standby"
