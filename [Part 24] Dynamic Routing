Dynamic Routing:
  - Dynamic Routing Protocols advertise info abou tthe routes they know from other routers

Protocols:
  - IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)
    - Share routes within a single AS
	Algorithm:
		- Distance Vector
			- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
			- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
		- Link State 
			- OSPF
			- IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
			
  - EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)
    - Share routes between AS's
    - Path Vector
		- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): Only EGP 
		
Distance Vector Protocols:
	- Sending known destination networks and metric to reach
	- Routing by rumor
	- Router does now know about the network beyond its neighbors
	- Share parts of route table with neighbors
	
Link State Protocols:
	- Each router creates a connectivity map
	- To allow this, each router advertises information about its interfaces until all routers develop the same map
	- Each router independently uses its own map
	- CPU heavy
	- Faster than distance vector
	
Metrics:
	- Lower metric = better
	- Same metric to same destination = load balancing between similar routes
		- ECMP (Equal Cost Multi-Path)
	- RIP: Hop Count
	- EIGRP: Bandwith and Delay
	- OSPF: Cost
	- ISIS: Cost (All hops 10 before config)
	
Administrative Distance:
	- Determines which routing protocol is preferred
	- Lower AD is preferred and indicates the protocol is considered is trustworthy 
	- ONLY APPLIES TO ROUTES TO THE SAME DESTINATION
