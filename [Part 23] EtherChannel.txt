EtherChannel (AKA Port Channel or LAG):
    - Grouped interfaces are treated as a single interfaces
    - EtherChannel ifaces are load balanced automatically

Load Balances:
    - Based on flows
    - Frames in the same flow will be forwarded using the same physical interface
    - Selection Calculation:
        - Source MAC
        - Destination MAC
        - Source + Destination MAC
        - Source and Destination IP (one, other, or both)
    - "show etherchannel load-balance"
    - "port-channel load-balance src-dst-mac"

EtherChannel Configuration:
    - PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol)
        - Cisco Protocol
        - "interface range <range>"
        - "channel-group 1 mode desirable"
    - LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) *
        - IEEE 802.3ad 
        - Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of EtherChannel
        - "channel-group 1 mode <active/passive>"
    - Static EtherChannel
        - ifaces are statically configured to form EtherChannel
    - Up to 8 ifaces can be formed into a single EtherChannel (16 for LACP but only 8 will be used)
    - "channel-protocol lacp/pagp"
        - Specify mode 
    - "interface port-channel <port-channel id>"
        - configure port challen
    - "show etherchannel summary"  
    - "show etherchannel port-channel"
