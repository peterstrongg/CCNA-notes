Link State Protocols:
	- Connectivity Maps are created on each router

OSPF:
	- Dijkstras Algorithm
	- OSPFv1: OLD Not in use
	- OSPFv2: IPv4 (CCNA)
	- OSPFv3: IPv6 and v4
	
	- Routers store info in LSAs( Link state ads)
	- Stored in LSDB (Link state DB)
	- Routers will flood LSAs until all routers in the OSPF area develop the same map of the network (LSDB)
	
LSA Flooding:
	- LSA Contents:
		- RID
		- IP
		- Cost

OSPF Basic steps:
	1. Become neighbors with other routers connected to the same segment
	2. Exchange LSAs with neighbor routers
	3. Calculate the best routes and insert into routing table

OSPF Areas:
	- Areas divide the network
	- Small networks can be single area without negative performance effects 
	- An area that share the same LSDB
	- Backbone area: All areas must connect to area 0 (backbone area)
	- Routers with all interface in the same area are called internal routers
	- Area Border Routers (ABRs) Areas that are in multiple areas
	- Recommended to have abr only connected to no more than 2 areas
	- Backbone routers: areas connected to the backbone area 
	
OSPF Configuration (Single Area):
	- "router ospf <process id>"
	- "network <ip> <wildcard mask> area <area #>"
	- "passive-interface <iface id>"
	-
